Philosophy
==========

The idea behind Frontend Core is pretty simple: create a framework providing the most common components and a standard architecture for today and tomorrow. Frontend Core doesn't reinvent CSS or JS techniques it just adapts some ideas pretty know for all the experts of the each area:

CSS / HTML
----------
- [Object oriented CSS](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/)
- [Atomic Design](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/)
- [Atomic CSS](https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2014/01/31/atomic-css-tool-set/)
- [Zen Coding](https://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/wiki/ZenCSSPropertiesEn)
- [The Single Responsability](http://csswizardry.com/2012/04/the-single-responsibility-principle-applied-to-css/)

Javascript
----------

- [Require JS](http://requirejs.org/)
- [AMD Modules](http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html)
- [Data attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes)
- [Scalable JavaScript Application Architecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKouqShWI4o)

But all this staff is just theory and when you try to combine all you will find that there is a huge work in front of you. That's what Frontend Core can do for you, translate this "ideal" way of work to the real world.
