Philosophy
==========

The idea behind Frontend Core is pretty simple: create a framework providing the most common components and a standard architecture for today and tomorrow. Frontend Core doesn't reinvent CSS or JS techniques it just adapts some ideas pretty know for all the experts of the each area:

CSS / HTML
----------

- `Object oriented CSS <http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss>`_
- `Atomic Design <http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/>`_
- `Atomic CSS <https://www.lucidchart.com/techblog/2014/01/31/atomic-css-tool-set/>`_
- `Zen Coding <https://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/wiki/ZenCSSPropertiesEn>`_
- `The Single Responsability principle <http://csswizardry.com/2012/04/the-single-responsibility-principle-applied-to-css/>`_

Javascript
----------

- `Require JS <http://requirejs.org/>`_
- `AMD Modules <http://requirejs.org/docs/whyamd.html>`_
- `Data attributes <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_data_attributes>`_
- `Scalable JavaScript Application Architecture <http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKouqShWI4o>`_

But all this staff is just theory and when you try to combine all you will find that there is a huge work in front of you. That's what Frontend Core can do for you, translate this "ideal" way of work to the real world.
