        <p class="mb-n">The grids in Frontendcore are totally configurable, you've got several columns options and you can overwrite the map $grid to personalize it:</p>
    <pre>
	<code data-fc-modules="code" class="hljs scss">
        $grid: (
        container-width: 1140px,
        // Defines the max width of the container. Could be px or %.

        gutters: .50,
        // Defines the width of the space between columns. Should be relative.

        ) !global;
    </code>
</pre>
        <p>By default the grid is set to 98% and modifies the with and position of the columns depending on the resolution of the device. Reduce and maximize this page to see it in action.</p>
        <p>The <strong class="c-primary">.grid-main</strong> class should be only added in the main grid of your page (usually called #container"). This class will add some paddings depending on the device you are.</p>
        <p>If you want to create fixed layouts (very useful for admin panels) add the <strong class="c-primary">.grid-fixed</strong> class to your main grid container.</p>
