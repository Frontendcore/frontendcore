## Setting up the environment

### Create main folder

Just create one folder called frontendcore in your computer and go inside it with your terminal

### Clone the Workspace repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Frontendcore/frontendcore.git workspace
```

### Clone the Scss repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Frontendcore/scss.git scss
```

### Clone the JS repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Frontendcore/js.git js
```

### Clone the Site repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Frontendcore/site.git js
```

### Clone the Generator repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Frontendcore/generator.git js
```

### Start contribute!

Now you have all what you need installed in your computer. Just forget all the repositories except the workspace. Here's where you have to work, and that's the one you need to fork. But the workspace compiles in all the other directories. To see your changes go to the site/build folder and start browsing the site.
